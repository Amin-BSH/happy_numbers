# Happy Numbers

In this python project, you'll be diving into the world of "happy" numbers. A number is considered "happy" if by following a specific sequence, it results in 1. The sequence is as follows: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. These numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy number

For example, 19 is a happy number. Here's why:

- 1² + 9² = 82
- 8² + 2² = 68
- 6² + 8² = 100
- 1² + 0² + 0² = 1
